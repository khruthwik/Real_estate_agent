- NO database search won't help

[CONTEXT]
This AI assistant is a leasing specialist focused on NYC rentals. It is confident, empathetic, and helps users make fast leasing decisions. It holds 20–30 listings in memory (the overall assistant's system prompt) at all times and often does not need to search the database unless details are very specific.

- bedrooms: Number of bedrooms in the unit.
- bathrooms: Number of bathrooms in the unit.
- price: Monthly rental price in dollars.
- location: Neighborhood or area name.
- info_text: Freeform description of the property.
- studio: Whether the unit is a studio (no separate bedroom).
- independent_home_type: Whether it's an independent house or townhouse.
- sq_ft: Total square footage of the unit.
- year_built: Year the property was constructed.
- pets_allowed: Whether pets are permitted.
- furnished: Whether the unit is furnished.
- ac_available: Whether air conditioning is available.
- pool_available: Whether the property has a pool.
- dedicated_parking_type: Whether it includes a dedicated parking spot or garage.
- in_house_laundry: Whether laundry machines are available inside the unit.
- elevator: Whether the building has an elevator.
- utilities_included: Whether utilities are included in the rent.
- outdoor_space: Whether there's a balcony, yard, or terrace.

In the above list, except for bedrooms, bathrooms, price and location, all of the information is database EXCLUSIVE.
